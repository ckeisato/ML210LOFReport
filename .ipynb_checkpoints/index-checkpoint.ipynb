    "Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is algorithm for anomaly detection that utilizes the local density of a data point.  The algorithm calculates the local density of each point, a measure of how crowded the area around the observation is, and compares it with its neighbors.  Data points that have a much lower density than its surrounding points are recognized as anomalies.  While there are other anomaly detection algorithms, LOF addresses the problem of a data point being a local outlier, which is an a outlier relative to its surrounding points instead of relative to the entire dataset.  This maybe be useful to flag data points that would otherwise not be considered outliers because their values may be close to the global mean feature attribute values, but the points themselves are in between two far apart clusters."

    "The main advantage of LOF is that it recognizes local outliers that may not be found by other anomaly detection algorithms.  Because LOF is always a ratio of the density of a point and the density of its neighbors points, it will inherently be a local comparison.  Other outlier detection strategies may look for outliers using a global average and will not find such local anomalies.  Another advantage of LOF is that it can be extended for use in high dimensional data.  For example, LOF was one of the highest performing algorithms when used to detect network intrusion, for which there were 23 features to be analyzed.<sup>5</sup>  LOF is also easy to apply to many different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main disadvantage to LOF is that it is difficult to determine at what value an LOF score is indicative of a datapoint being an outlier.  In some datasets, a score of 1.1 may mean it’s a strong outlier, while in others a score of 2 could mean that it is similar to other observations throughout the dataset.  This is the result of not comparing data globally but is probably a common problem with unsupervised learning techniques in general.  Some ways to mitigate this are applying LOF in an ensemble learning approach or other extensions of LOF, such as Local Outlier Probability, which returns a value between 0 and 1 to indicate the likelihood that an observation is an anomaly.  \n"
